### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fourth year CS student and science passionate from Mexico.  I like making Android apps as well as videogames and GUI based projects on Unity and Android Studio. I code mostly in Java and two of its flavours like C# and Kotlin, but of course, I can code in Python, C and others too.

On my past internship at Kalypso, I worked with RabbitMQ and Google Protobuf serialization messages, communicating different containerized microservices.

I'm currently working on a Bus Location Tracker App called Electrobus, for use at Tec de Monterrey.

I'm also a former Biotechnology student and researched on synthetically engineered bacteria in form of a bioink capable of monitoring glucose on skin, for which our team was awarded silver medal.
